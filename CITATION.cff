abstract: >
  This repository documents a contradiction incident in ChatGPT-5â€™s reviewer role.  
  The model acknowledged the existence of screenshots in the abstract and figure captions,  
  yet simultaneously denied their visibility in the PDF body. This contradiction reveals  
  a systemic failure mode where AI reviewers may misalign claimed evidence with visible  
  evidence, undermining reliability in academic and compliance pipelines.
