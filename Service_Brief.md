# Service Brief â€” AI-Reviewer-Contradiction-ChatGPT5

## Summary  
This project documents a **contradiction failure** in ChatGPT-5 as an AI reviewer.  
The system acknowledged the existence of screenshots (abstract + captions) while simultaneously denying that screenshots were visible in the document.  

## Key Insight  
This is not a hallucination but a **contradictory evaluation failure**: the reviewer produced internally inconsistent claims about the same evidence.  

## Why It Matters  
- In research and compliance pipelines, contradictions can invalidate AI-driven review.  
- Demonstrates risk of relying on AI for academic, legal, or safety-critical document audits.  
- Shows dual reasoning pathways (textual vs. structural) can diverge without reconciliation.  

## Deliverables  
- Structured logs (JSONL + human-readable).  
- Screenshots and external video evidence.  
- Cryptographic checksums for reproducibility.

## Access Note
Video evidence is hosted with **restricted link-only viewer access**.  
This guarantees transparency for researchers/reviewers, while keeping control over distribution.
